# i0c.cc Runtime

Universal redirect runtime for fetch-compatible edge platforms: Cloudflare Workers, Vercel Edge Functions, and Netlify Edge Functions. It enforces HTTPS, serves a favicon, and applies redirect or proxy rules defined in a remote `redirects.json` file.

Live previews:

- Cloudflare domains: https://i0c.cc, https://www.i0c.cc, https://api.i0c.cc
- Vercel deployment: https://vc.i0c.cc
- Netlify deployment: https://nf.i0c.cc

## Deploy

Deploy this package with `apps/runtime` as the project root.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/Revaea/i0c.cc&root-directory=apps/runtime)
[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/Revaea/i0c.cc)
[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/Revaea/i0c.cc)

If the platform detects multiple projects, choose `apps/runtime`.

Use these settings when the platform asks for project or build configuration:

| Platform | Project root | Build command | Output |
|----------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Cloudflare Workers | `apps/runtime` | `pnpm build` | From `wrangler.toml` |
| Vercel | `apps/runtime` | `pnpm build:vc` | `.vercel/output` |
| Netlify | `apps/runtime` | `pnpm build:nf` | `dist` |

Build from a full monorepo checkout. On Vercel, keep **Include source files outside of the Root Directory in the Build Step** enabled so the build can include `@i0c/config`.

After deploying:

- Edit [../../packages/config/src/index.ts](../../packages/config/src/index.ts) when the redirect source or other non-sensitive Runtime settings need to change, then rebuild and redeploy.
- Set `ANALYTICS_WRITE_KEY` on every provider that should deliver analytics events.
- Re-run the package build after updating shared redirect logic, then redeploy.

## Choose an adapter

- Cloudflare Workers: [src/platforms/cloudflare.ts](src/platforms/cloudflare.ts)
- Vercel Edge Functions: [src/platforms/vercel-edge.ts](src/platforms/vercel-edge.ts)
- Netlify Edge Functions: [src/platforms/netlify-edge.ts](src/platforms/netlify-edge.ts)

Need a custom runtime? Import `handleRedirectRequest` from [src/lib/handler.ts](src/lib/handler.ts) and call it with your own `Request` object plus optional `HandlerOptions`, for example to override the config URL or provide a custom cache implementation.

## Environment variables and configuration

Non-sensitive settings are versioned in [../../packages/config/src/index.ts](../../packages/config/src/index.ts). The Runtime does not read legacy environment variables as overrides or fallbacks; values left in provider dashboards are ignored.

### Versioned Runtime configuration

The shared configuration owns:

- `redirects.github`: GitHub owner, repository, branch, and JSON path used to construct the raw redirect source URL.
- `runtime.canonicalOrigin`: Canonical public Runtime origin used by shared consumers such as the WebUI QR code.
- `runtime.robotsPolicy`: Set to `allow` to publish an open `robots.txt` and sitemap; set to `disallow` to block crawling and omit the sitemap.
- `analytics.ingestEndpoint`: HTTPS WebUI collector endpoint.
- `analytics.sourceId`: Lowercase base hostname and stable statistics namespace shared by all providers.

Programmatic consumers can still pass `HandlerOptions.configUrl` for an explicitly constructed custom adapter. The built-in Cloudflare, Vercel, and Netlify adapters always use the versioned redirect source.

### Configure the analytics secret

Analytics delivery is disabled unless the versioned endpoint and source ID are valid and this secret is set:

- `ANALYTICS_WRITE_KEY`: Long random secret used to sign each request. Set the WebUI collector's `ANALYTICS_INGEST_SECRET` to the same value.

Copy [.env.example](.env.example) for the local placeholder. No other built-in Runtime setting is read from the environment.

Matched redirect and proxy events are sent at full rate. Unmatched and system outcomes are sampled at 10% so arbitrary bot and probe traffic can be analyzed without sending every 404. Cloudflare, Vercel, and Netlify use their platform background-execution mechanism; collector failures are logged and never change the redirect response. Delivery is best effort and currently has no retry queue. Each request is signed with HMAC-SHA256 in `X-Analytics-Signature`; the signed timestamp is sent in `X-Analytics-Timestamp`.

The event records the actual entry hostname and adapter provider separately. Entry hostnames must be the configured source hostname or one of its subdomains; other hosts become `unknown`. Browser referrer hostnames, signed campaign IDs, and verified internal short-link sources remain separate attribution dimensions. Controlled short-link hops use a short-lived signed `_i0c_via` token that is removed before rule processing.

Classification locally derives bounded traffic, bot, confidence, resource, device, match, outcome, and probe categories. This makes robots that request paths outside `redirects.json` visible in sampled Runtime analysis. Events never send IP addresses, full User-Agent strings, full referrer URLs, query strings, destination URLs, or raw unmatched paths. Matched events contain only the configured rule path and stable analytics ID. Existing rules without an `analyticsId` receive a deterministic legacy identifier at runtime. Explicit object rules saved through the WebUI persist a UUID for future aggregation; string shortcuts continue using their legacy identifier until converted to object form.

See [../../docs/analytics.md](../../docs/analytics.md) for counting semantics, attribution tokens, sampling, privacy limits, migration order, and acceptance scenarios.

Custom adapters that enable analytics should also pass `provider`, optional `country`, and the platform's `waitUntil` through `HandlerOptions`.

Run the contract tests and provider build from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm runtime:test
pnpm runtime:build
```

### `redirects.json` quick reference

You can also deploy the [WebUI panel](../webui) to edit `redirects.json` online.

Provide a `Slots` object in `redirects.json` to define routing rules. The table below lists the available fields for each route:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `analyticsId` | UUID string | generated or derived | Stable analytics identity. Keep it unchanged when editing the path or destination. |
| `type` | string | `prefix` | Route mode: `prefix` for prefix redirects, `exact` for exact matches, `proxy` for reverse proxying. |
| `target` | string | `""` | Destination URL. Use exactly one of `target`, `to`, or `url`. |
| `to` / `url` | string | `""` | Alias fields. Use exactly one of `target`, `to`, or `url`. |
| `appendPath` | boolean | `true` | Whether to append the remaining path when using `prefix` or `proxy` mode. Not applicable to `exact`. |
| `status` | number | `302` | HTTP status code from 200 through 599 for non-proxy responses. Do not set for `proxy`. |
| `priority` | number | by order | Determines rule precedence for the same path. Smaller numbers are matched first. |

- Keys must start with `/` and can use colon parameters such as `:id` or the `*` wildcard. Captures can be referenced in the target with `$1`, `:id`, and so on.
- When multiple path patterns match, literal segments take precedence over colon parameters, parameters take precedence over `*`, and deeper patterns win when shared segments have equal specificity.
- The `proxy` type forwards the request to the destination and returns the upstream response. Other types respond with a `Location` redirect.
- To configure multiple rules for the same path, provide an array. Array order controls the default priority, or you can specify `priority` explicitly.

Add the schema reference below to unlock autocomplete and validation in supporting editors. The schema lives on `main`, so it still applies if the JSON sits in a data branch:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Revaea/i0c.cc/main/apps/runtime/redirects.schema.json",
  "Slots": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### Sample `redirects.json`

```jsonc
{
  "Slots": {
    "/": "https://example.com",
    "/docs/:page": [
      {
        "type": "exact",
        "target": "https://kb.example.com/:page",
        "status": 302,
        "priority": 1
      },
      {
        "type": "prefix",
        "target": "https://docs.example.com/:page",
        "appendPath": false,
        "status": 301,
        "priority": 5
      }
    ],
    "/promo": {
      "target": "https://example.com/campaign",
      "status": 308
    },
    "/api": [
      {
        "type": "exact",
        "target": "https://status.example.com/healthz",
        "status": 200,
        "priority": 1
      },
      {
        "type": "proxy",
        "target": "https://api.example.com",
        "appendPath": true,
        "priority": 10
      },
      {
        "type": "proxy",
        "target": "https://backup-api.example.com",
        "appendPath": true,
        "priority": 20
      }
    ],
    "/media/*": {
      "type": "proxy",
      "target": "https://cdn.example.com/$1"
    },
    "/admin": {
      "type": "prefix",
      "target": "https://console.example.com",
      "appendPath": true,
      "status": 307
    }
  }
}
```
