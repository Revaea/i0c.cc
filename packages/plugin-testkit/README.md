# Plugin Testkit

`@i0c/plugin-testkit` contains runner-neutral contract assertions for i0c.cc plugins. Official plugins use the same assertions for manifests, data sources, repositories, Runtime platforms, analytics sinks, analytics stores, health checks, and migrations.

This package is development-only. Production hosts and plugin bundles must depend on `@i0c/plugin-api`, not the testkit.
