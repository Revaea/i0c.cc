# @i0c/config

Shared data contracts and bootstrap package for Runtime and WebUI configuration.

Normal instance settings live in `config.json` on the `data` branch and are validated by [config.schema.json](config.schema.json) plus the edge-compatible validator in [src/validation.ts](src/validation.ts). Runtime and WebUI fetch the document remotely, so valid updates do not require rebuilding either application.

Redirect rules live beside it in `redirects.json` and are described by [redirects.schema.json](redirects.schema.json). Keeping both data document schemas here avoids coupling the WebUI editor to the Runtime application package.

[src/defaults.ts](src/defaults.ts) contains only the safe fallback and bootstrap values needed before remote configuration can be loaded: the GitHub repository, data branch, document paths, and OAuth scope. Change these values only when moving the source itself; bootstrap changes require rebuilding consumers.

Secrets and deployment bindings remain in each application's environment variables. This package must never contain credentials, database URLs, signing keys, or authentication secrets.

Plugin settings are namespaced under `plugins`. Public JSON values may be stored there, while `secrets` contains environment-variable binding names rather than secret values. Consumers bundle the TypeScript source directly, so the package build validates the source without producing a checked-in artifact.

Run the package check from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm config:check
```
